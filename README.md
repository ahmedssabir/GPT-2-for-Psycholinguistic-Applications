# Cloze-Probability-With-GPT-2

The probability that a given stem (e.g., Joe mowed the [blank]) will be completed with a particular word (e.g., lawn) by a group of subjects is known as that word's cloze probability. This measure has been very useful in psycholinguistics as an index of the predictability of a word as it appears in context. Measuring cloze probabilities by directly surveying human subjects quickly becomes very expensive if you want to measure the contextual predictability of every word in a corpus. I am interested if we can get a reliable estimate of this probability using a language model (!GPT-2(https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)).
